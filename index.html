            About UTF-8
            ===========
            UTF-8	A character in UTF8 can be from 1 to 4 bytes long. UTF-8 can
            represent any character in the Unicode standard. UTF-8 is backwards 
            compatible with ASCII. 
            
            UTF-8 is the preferred encoding for e-mail and web pages.

            The default character encoding in HTML-5 is UTF-8. 
            **TODO**: So, we realy do not need the below meta tag but for now 
                      just leaving it there - but need to confirm.

                Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
                Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown 
                printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
                It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, 
                remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of 
                Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing 
                software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
